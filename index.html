            <h3>Yifan Shen</h3>
            <p>Hi, my name is Yifan Shen, Yvon is my English name. I am from Shanghai, an international metropolis located in the middle of the eastern coastline of China. Chinese is my native language. I have been in Melbourne for about three years. Throughout high school, because of my strong interest in IT, I have studied Applied Computing and Software Development. Computers have always given me a platform to demonstrate my creativity and increase my general knowledge. For my previous coursework, I designed a project plan which related to the COVID-19 drone monitoring in Applied Computing and made a program which I called it for "Filter Bubble" in Software Development. This gave me a great number of experiences in IT. In my spare time, I sometimes create some small programs, testing out new functions or combining old features which provides me a good opportunity to see my progress as a software developer. The major for further education that I pursue here in RMIT is Information Technology. In my leisure time, I have a great number of hobbies. Playing the piano can be one of them. Doing sports is also an integral part of my life. In my spare time, I love road-bike cycling. During the ride, I can not only relax my mind, exercise my body, but also enjoy the beautiful scenery along the way. I also enjoy playing tennis, basketball and badminton. Collecting things is also one of my favourite hobbies, ranging from sneakers, Pokémon cards, coins, stamps, etc. My most-liked thing to do on vocations is to travel. It is undoubtedly a fantastic thing to go and see where you want to go, photographing and discover the beauty of the earth. The place I most look forward to is Antarctica. For photography, for adventure, for icebergs, for wildlife, for another world…

I enjoy watching videos on computer setups I cannot afford on the internet and anime in my free time. I work casually as a coffee barista at a hotel. As an international student in Melbourne, I find it quite challenging due to it being a new environment, however I am slowly getting used to the culture here. I dream to earn enough money so I can travel around the world. I aspire to work in the technology industry in the future and I hope to learn useful skills such as programming and broaden my knowledge regarding the world of tech.

                Hello I'm Michael Khalil, I'm currently 18 years of age as of 2022 and just finished highschool last year completing VCE. As of this year I am currently enrolled at RMIT Melbourne studying my first year for my  Bachelor of Information technology degree. I was born here in Australia but both sides of my family came from Egypt, with both my parents moving from Egypt to Melbourne as migrants. Because of my constant exposure to Egyptian culture and the Arabic language, I understand spoken Arabic vaguely (but cant read it!) and can barely speak it. Through primary and high school I also know basic Italian. My hobbies and interests include, Video Games, computer hardware, IT as a whole, japanese cars and modifying them, as well as motorsports in general (especially Formula 1!), and even a bit of anime.

            <h3>Yifan Shen</h3>
            <p>The three tests I conducted were the Myers-Briggs personality test, the learning style test and the Big 5 Personality test.</p>
<p>Through the results, it shows that I’m the Protagonist. I found that I am receptive. Although sometimes I don't agree with someone, I will also recognize his/her right to speak out the truth. Everyone can count on my personality type to see my commitment and responsibility. From this point, it can be seen that I'm reliable. From the altruistic personality, I genuinely believe that if I bring people together, I can make them feel very happy. I'm also passionate and charismatic. Firmness and inspiration are my strengths, I often find my way into leadership roles. As a person high in Openness, I am more able than the average person to connect seemingly unrelated concepts. This makes me more creative and imaginative than average, and more likely to appreciate unusual ideas. I have the ability of self-discipline and control in order to pursue my goals. </p>
<p>However, my weakness is that sometimes I am overly idealistic and become unrealistic. I put pressure on myself to right every wrong that I encounter. But no matter how hard I strive; it just isn’t realistic for me to solve all the world’s problems.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Roy Loh</h3>
            <p>
                I conducted three tests, the Myers Briggs test, the learning styles quiz and the big five factors test.

From the Myers-Briggs test, I was assigned with an adventurer personality trait, which means Im an introverted, observant, feeling and prospecting person. I live an eventful life where I am inspired by people around me and I'm constantly experimenting on myself, trying to recreate and reinvent myself. However, I occasionally have to recharge my social battery after occasionally going out and meeting new people. Occasionally when in arguments, I can lose my temper and get caught up in the heat of the moment.

According to my results using the learning styles quiz, my primary working style is pragmatist, meaning that I need a clear vision on how to apply what I have learnt into practice in the real world. Learning methods include practicals, problem setting, discussions and case studies. Pragmatists are constantly experimenting with new theories and ideas to see if they work.

Finally, according to the big % factors test, I have scored lower than 50% of the people who have taken this test in factors such as extroversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness and intellect, indicating that I am a introverted person, who constantly has disagreements with people. I also lack intellectual knowledge and conscientiousness and I am also emotionally unstable.

Based on these 3 results, I am a quiet person who likes to observe my surroundings, to only speak up when I know what is going on. Because of this, I am usually quiet when around people which can cause misunderstandings.

            <p>
                The three tests I conducted were the Myers-Briggs personality test, the Big 5 Personality test and the learning style test.

In the Myers-Briggs personality test, I received the assertive entertainer personality, where I am  a very social and energetic person, and as a result I am socially aware of the people around me and try to help others in need. I try to live in the moment and make it as enjoyable as possible for myself and the people around me. However sometimes I can be distracted and lose focus on the task at hand.

For my Learning Style Test, I am primarily a tactile learner, so it means I learn much better hands on, through touching, moving, building and drawing to learn, rather than watching and listening.

As for my Big 5 personality test, I am very open, extraverted and agreeable. However, I can lack conscientiousness and neuroticism

To summarise these tests, I am a social and energetic person, and I'm socially aware of the people around me and how they feel. Because of this I can help those in need in groups but in some cases I can be distracted and lose focus on what needs to be done

            <h3>Jin Guo</h3>
            <p>I conducted three tests, the Myers Briggs test, the learning style quiz and a creative test. This is the combined results of the three tests.
                I'm a visual learner, I learn best by reading and seeing pictures, and most importantly
                by the demonstration of others. Although I have strong opinions, I am not closed minded and are
                willing to listen to others' options fully, this ensures the positive environment of the team,
                and that everyone has the right to speak their options even though I know that their points are not correct.
                I’m reliable, even though it’s hard to see, but I will keep my promises and complete the responsibilities
                that are assigned to me.
                But the weaknesses of my personality is that Most of the time I’m kind of forcing others to believe in my
                values, opinions, thoughts and ideas. I enjoy teaching, but at times, attempting to “enlighten” others may
                come across as patronising, which is not the most effective strategy for persuading other people.

                The three tests that were administered are, the Myers Briggs test, psychotic test and a learning style test.

Through the results it shows that im an analyst. Analysts are innately curious, this helps them to
ensure that their ideas are workable, rather than just clever. These personality types have a strong
drive to learn, and they want to find out things for themselves rather than accept received wisdom.
These types may be found stockpiling books, questioning teachers, spurring debates, or driving
conversations in forums across the Internet.

The learning style test shows that i am a visual learner, Visual learning is a form of learning style in
which individuals like to communicate concepts and thoughts using images, graphics, colours, and maps.
 In order to learn something, visual learners need to see it.  I am more likely to have a photographic
 memory and recall information using colour, tone, and brightness. Visual learners will benefit from
 seeing diagrams drawn out on a powerpoint or in presentations in class.

The psychotic test results showed that i am 67% psychotic. Through my conscience is in the right place i
Also have a pragmatic streak and generally not afraid to do my own dirty work. I generally have little
Trouble seeing things from another persons perspective, but at the same time am no push over.

            <h3>Michael Khalil</h3>
            <p>My ideal job is something primarily focused around the back end development of applications, so a software developer position is my primary goal. Coding and testing programs are something I am interested in. I will require a good understanding in all the fundamentals of programming, including a variety of languages and development environments. The applications I would develop can be for mobile devices, Windows, Linux and MacOS or even proprietary software for niche devices. I currently know Visual Basic and a little bit of Python through university in terms of programming languages. Through university I also know a bit of HTML, CSS, GIT and SQL. However, my current knowledge is still inadequate for real world industry applications and hopefully my portfolio and knowledge can increase by the time I finish university to be an attractive employee. In this industry it is important to communicate with other project members to meet deadlines and figure out issues and meet requirements of the scope of the solution. So I need to be vocal and engaged with my team because of my role as a software developer so I can do my job efficiently and effectively.

            <p>My ideal job is to become a website developer. The position above is a web developer, responsible for development of online retail store websites. The most appealing thing to me in this business is their wages and advertised casual and friendly working environment and most importantly a flat hierarchy, where they have an organisational structure with few or no levels of middle management between staff and executives, as I don't like to be bossed around. And this can avoid problem of higher executive’s discriminatory treatments of the lower classes in the organisation. Furthermore, I can learn more about website development as I work, which can build great experience for my future business. The skills that I would need for this position is to be reliable, team-oriented, self-motivated, have excellent time management skills, and demonstrate strong attention to detail. The skills that I have from this list is that I am reliable,I always do what I say and always keep my promises, for team assignments I will alway do my work and won't let the team down. Self oriented and motivated, and have great time management skills, I keep all schedules and dates in my calendar to prevent myself from forgetting.
                Experience with all of the following technologies is a requirement: JavaScript, NodeJS,
                SQL databases,TML, CSS, git version control software. I haven't got any experience from any of the above softwares, but I'm currently learning SQL data and Github website development. I will learn more and more and gain experience for SQL data and Github website development through the course of my study at RMIT.

            <p>My ideal job is a software engineer. The position of software engineer implies that there is more to the work than simply being a coder. Engineering requires thoughtful planning and strategy in decision making, in order to produce maintainable systems. I am attracted to the back-end nature of this role as it will provide me with the opportunity to explore writing business logic using typescript and node.js which I have not yet been exposed to. Software engineers are in charge of creating and implementing efficient software solutions to fulfil the needs of their clients. Most Software Engineers specialise in one field and may be in charge of anything from web applications and content management systems to databases and operating systems. When people think of web development, its usually linked to web design and user interfaces, however I am interested in discovering and understanding how everything works ‘under the hood.’ A job as a software engineer is  both exciting and difficult if you like problem solving and have good analytical abilities. And, as technology advances, the need for software engineers grows (far faster than the national average, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) Because practically all organisations utilise software, a job as a software engineer allows you to work in a wide range of sectors and professions. Whether you are interested in banking, entertainment, sports, real estate, or another profession, there is a strong possibility that there are opportunities for software engineers available, It's also a vocation that allows you to work from anywhere. You might be able to work from home for organisations in different states or even other countries.

Based on 27435 postings in 2018, some IT specific skills of a solutions architect have high number of selections such as project management with 2252 selections, and business management with 2141 and building relationships with 2119. However, general skills are more sought after by employers these days compared to IT skills.The general skills of a solutions architect rank highly in demand among employers. Based on 121997 postings available between March 2017 and February 2018, communication skills rank first with 44367, problem solving skills are second with 16445 and teamwork and collaboration is 5th with 14364 postings. From this, we can tell that the general skillset of a solutions architect is highly sought after by employers. Three highest ranking IT skills not in my skill set are SQL, Javascript and JAVA. Three highest ranking general skills not in my skill set are organisational skills, writing and troubleshooting. After looking through the data displayed by the Burning Glass, I am surprised by the demand of solutions architects as I have not expected it to be so highly sought after. A solutions architect is a flexible role and depending on the employer and project at hand, a solutions architect might have to pick up certain skills along the way. Overall this is good for me as my chances of employment will be better in the future.

            <p>According to the Burning Glass Technology data as of march 2018, My ideal career as a software developer falls under the “software developer / engineer” section of their data. This has over 29,000 selections, and is currently the most sought after position in the IT industry. For context the next highest demand positions are “computer systems engineer / architect” with only around 13,000 selections, which is much less than half software developers and engineers.

                In terms of technical/IT skills, the three most sought after IT skills that I do not have are SQL, JavaScript and JAVA (which are also the top 3 IT skills from the data). with around 3600, 3000 and 2900 active selections respectively between december 2017 to march 2018. Personally I do not enjoy using SQL from current university courses but I still need to develop my knowledge, but if I was to be an attractive candidate for multiple positions, learning SQL, JavaScript and JAVA would be significant as they are the most sought after skills. My current IT skills are in much less demand in comparison with python as an example with only around 1200 active selections in the same period.

                In terms of general skills, my top three skills that I do not have are organisation skills, planning and leadership (the 3rd, 7th and 11th most desirable general skills), with 15,800, 11,300 and 5,100 active selections respectively between december 2017 to march 2018. I consider myself to not be the most meticulous in planning and organisation and personally am not one who likes being a leader in a group, but these are skills that can make me a much more efficient and reliable employee in the workspace. However I feel like I do have the most important skill required which is communication skills which is greatly sought after with almost 45,000 active selections in the same period.

                This Burning Glass Technology data has given me a greater insight into the industry I plan to get into. This data has encouraged me to pursue my ideal job of being a software developer because of the fact that it is the most sought after occupation in the IT industry. However, I probably need to develop my IT technical skills because my current technical skill set is not in very high demand. My general skill sets have what is most desired, which is communication skills but I can become more organised. I believe that increasing my technical skill set is the most important thing I can improve on so I can be versatile and very attractive to potential employers.

            <h3>Jin Guo</h3>
            <p>My ideal job is to become a website developer. The position above is a web developer, responsible for development of online retail store websites. The most appealing thing to me in this business is their wages and advertised casual and friendly working environment and most importantly a flat hierarchy, where they have an organisational structure with few or no levels of middle management between staff and executives, as I don't like to be bossed around. And this can avoid problem of higher executive’s discriminatory treatments of the lower classes in the organisation. Furthermore, I can learn more about website development as I work, which can build great experience for my future business. The skills that I would need for this position is to be reliable, team-oriented, self-motivated, have excellent time management skills, and demonstrate strong attention to detail. The skills that I have from this list is that I am reliable,I always do what I say and always keep my promises, for team assignments I will alway do my work and won't let the team down. Self oriented and motivated, and have great time management skills, I keep all schedules and dates in my calendar to prevent myself from forgetting.
                Experience with all of the following technologies is a requirement: JavaScript, NodeJS,
                SQL databases,TML, CSS, git version control software. I haven't got any experience from any of the above softwares, but I'm currently learning SQL data and Github website development. I will learn more and more and gain experience for SQL data and Github website development through the course of my study at RMIT.

                My ideal job is ranked number 15th in the top titles under the Burning glass industry datas it falls under the “website development” section of their data. This has 381 selections. It's not really a sought after position in the industry as it's ranked near the bottom of the data.
                In terms of specialised skills, I don't have any of the top 3 ranked skills in the data which is SQL, javascript and JAVA. With around 3600, 3000 and 2900 selections respectively from the 2107 to the 2018 data. These will be skills that I will learn in the course of my study at RMIT. I find that I'm studying SQL datas this semester, and I find that it's the most difficult out of all my courses that I am studying this semester.
                In Terms of baseline skills, besides communication (which is the number 1 desired skill), I do have problem solving and organisation skills which are the second and third most desired skills. Growing up I did not like speaking in front of groups and I'm generally the most quiet in a group of friends. With that being said my chances of employment in the future seems pretty optimistic as the website developer ranked number 15th will impact the competition of the job. While i have most of the top ranked specialised and baseline skills

            <h3>Taha Elsukkari</h3>
            <p>My dream career path is to become a software developer, as per the Burning Glass Technology statistics as of March 2018, the Software Developer / Engineer component of their dataset receives over 29,000 applicants and is currently ranked 11th in the Tech sector. Software engineers are in charge of creating and implementing efficient software solutions to fulfil the needs of their clients. Most Software Engineers specialise in one field and may be in charge of anything from web applications and content management systems to databases and operating systems. The most sought after IT related skills are SQL with 3570 postings, Javascript with 2946 postings and JAVA with 2860 postings. I am currently lacking in regards to the three most popular skills but aim to understand and learn these skills, with the course im currently doing its allow me to identify what my interests are in IT, and that is programming, im quite confident that learning these languages will be of great benefit to me. The top three basic skills that are sought after in IT are Communication skills with 44,367 postings, Problem solving with 16,445 postings and organisational skills with 15,844 postings. I believe that i have great communication skills as i am quite an extroverted person when it comes to team events and working on tasks, My problem solving abilities are also quite good as i have experience training that skill with tasks such as school/gaming. Finally i do lack quite a bit when it comes to organisational skills as i procrastinate quite a bit and only get work done at the last minute, working on this skill will allow me to improve my chances of landing a job.

            <p>
                <h3>System Analyst</h3>
                Systems Analysts are responsible is analysing the current system when rollout, upgrading and expanding the system. they really need to understand what problems in the system need to be solved by talking to stakeholders and users. cuz they also need to maintain the current system. doing programming and knowing how to deal with databases is required.  if there is no in-house technical solution, they have to check what's out in the market. after finding a solution they need to propose the solution with the information about the cost and the benefits to their organisation.
they work with software engineers, system developers, and system administrators, so knowing how to be a team player is essential for Systems analysts.
their schedule is partially decided by meetings, and spend most of their time analysing current systems and doing research on new technologies,
The most challenging part is the position requires them to be able to confront new technologies all the time, so that they can implement the new technologies in the current system to find solutions in a creative way.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Cloud Architect</h3>
The day-to-day activity of cloud architects is establishing the best practice for cloud usage with the company, IT security tasks to monitor to develop incident response procedures, calculating the cost of cloud infrastructure, and designing cloud infrastructure. they should have a broad knowledge of every position in every IT department. It is a heavy design role, have knowledge of not only one cloud provider, but many providers like AWS, GCP, so, they can maximise the potential benefits from each cloud provider.
They work with almost any IT department in the organisation, starting with executives like CEO CIO CFO, work with the manager, the engineers, they would ask a lot of questions to cloud architects about cloud infrastructure. and find problems and make improvements based on the information from various IT departments.
The most challenging part about this job is they are required to deal with a multi-cloud environment, unlike solution architects, who only need to have knowledge about a single cloud service provider, and all the cloud service providers update their service frequently, it takes a lot of time or cloud architects to update their knowledge while provider make any change.
<br>
<br>
<h3>System Administrator</h3>
Being a system administrator is very similar to being a system engineer, it requires working overtime and working during the night and weekend. At beginning day, they always have a routine like double-checking everything in system is working. and looking at the system log and event log, make sure everything in the system is healthy. But their schedule is not fixed, requires some flexibility, other portions of the day-to-day task are work systems like ticketing systems. it is necessary for system administrators to have meetings with manufacturers or any organisations that provide products to their companies. The Challenging part about this position is requiring various technology, so system administrators would be easily pulled into so many directions, that they need to be structured and organised. otherwise, the workflow would be very stressful.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Devops Engineer</h3>
The daily life for being a DevOps engineer is doing troubleshooting and documentation for a week and doing programming for the current project they are working on. So it is their is job is kind of fragmented, especially in a small team running a lot of infrastructures, but at some point they need to have meeting with with their team member or another team, writing code and fighting with AWS. the project can be very different between which IT department they are in, such as web application, mobile application, AI, big data, robotic visualisation simulation and more. “DevOps” is actually referring to a culture, rather than just a position. Which combine the development and operation, which improve the efficiency of the workflow. One of the example of DevOps team is "realising engineering" - developing the infrastructure then delivering the product to the customers, lets say if they develop a calculator application, when one of the member within the devops team develop a new feature, they would creat a new brunch in GitHub, after the developer finishes the process, another developer or developers would test the new feature on every platform, like windows, ios ... if there is any problem, the developer who developed teh new feature can move on keep working on other features for the project, and no time would be wasted.

            <h2 id="itech">Cloud</h2>
            <img src="cloud.jpg" alt='Cloud'>
            <p>
            
                Cloud services are web based platforms, software and infrastructure that are hosted by third party providers such as Azure cloud or AWS, and made available to be used throughout the internet by individuals, businesses and organisations.
Cloud computing enables businesses and individuals to consume resources online, such as databases, storage, memory, data transfer, virtual machines and pay-as-you-go.
Cloud computing is a major improvement over traditional computing. Unlike traditional computing where regular maintenance is needed which will result in IT labour costs, cloud service providers will provide maintainability and automatic updates to new databases, OS and softwares, to ensure everything is up to date.
Cloud service providers will also ensure data is secured. This allows businesses to cut operational costs, such as less hardware, databases, software licences and servers.
Cloud computing models also improve upon older ones, for example a pay-as-you-go model charges for resources as they are being used. Monthly usage is tracked, and the user only has to pay for used resources.
Cloud computing is scalable and reliable. There is an unlimited number of resources that can be utilised by users. Processing of resources increases based on users' needs, the user can always scale down if resources are not needed.
Cloud services are also managed by service providers meaning that it can be accessed 24/7, therefore the business and organisation does not have to worry about maintaining the servers, thus cutting costs of labour to maintain their hardware.
Cloud service providers have multiple data centres located throughout the world, which make them faster and more reliable. AWS is currently leading the world with the largest global footprint, with 86 availability zones throughout 26 regions.
Cloud computing can be divided into three major categories, Infrastructure as a service(Iaas), platform as a service(Paas) and software as a service(Saas). Majority of the top cloud service providers provide all these 3 services. An entire IT computing infrastructure is offered by Iaas, which will be provisioned and managed over the internet. The key components of Iaas are used to replace existing development and test environments, virtual machines, website hosting, storage, networking, servers, backup, applications and data, middleware and high performance computing. Paas provides a full development and deployment environment in the cloud, which includes debugging, deployment tools and services, testing and dev. Saas is when someone else develops and hosts a software, and this software is later used by businesses or individuals when they need to do so.
Future of cloud:
Increase storage capacity - With the high volume of incoming data, it will be difficult for businesses to store data securely. Therefore the demand for cloud computing will be increasing drastically with many businesses adopting cloud computing. Cloud service providers will compete among one another to provide larger data centres at lower prices, and companies will be able to store large amounts of data securely.
Increased security - Data stored in the cloud is secure, but not entirely. Some companies which provide cloud services take security for granted. Large amounts of data often attract cyber criminals, therefore in the future, cloud service providers are likely to provide better security measures to prevent cyberattacks.
Modular software will be a priority - Programs are becoming increasingly complex, and the size of programs are also bigger than before, therefore advanced system thinking will soon be needed in cloud technology. We can see software being developed in various angles because in the future, applications will be stored not only in the cloud but in other places as well. The application will be stored on different modules of the servers located on different clouds. Service companies are currently using various types of software which have yet to be modified, which leads to the fact that modified software which is required in cloud computing tol provide better and improved security and facilities. This software will be more user friendly and flexible towards end users. This software will be advantageous towards the company as it will be both cost and time efficient.
Over the years, cloud computing has moved from an innovative concept to a booming industry. In 1969, a computer scientist named J.C.R. Licklider proposed a concept of interconnected computer systems of computers, which was later developed into the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network(ARPANET), a predecessor of the internet. ARPANET was the first network that enabled the sharing of digital data between computers remotely. During the following decades, many advancements happened such as IBM’s virtual machine operating system, which enables the creation of a computer virtually, which can then be operated like a real computer physically. Other popular hardware virtualization platforms included tools like Vagrant and parallels for Mac would appear along the way, and eventually virtual private networks would be created for business purposes leading to the development of modern cloud computing infrastructure. Salesforce became the first company that offered software-as-a-service, and thus the era of cloud computing was born.

Cloud has provided new ways of accessing data cost efficiently and quickly, and allowed companies to boost innovation and leverage new technologies as they are invented and modified. Cloud has redefined how technology is embedded in everything we do, and changed the way it is built and delivered. However, the rise of cloud has also brought multiple social concerns, including:
Ethics in cloud - Data is essential for business decisions, however there are ethical concerns surrounding consumer data stored in cloud repositories that are being analysed by service providers. There are inevitable privacy and security concerns regarding how the data is used, especially when there is a desire to provide customised services. When a machine learning model makes a decision, they might reflect and even exaggerate biases of the developers of the system, causing negative consequences to affected consumers.
Digital divide - A gap will be formed between those with access and those without access to technology, the concept of a digital divide was first formed when the iPhone penetrated into the smartphone market, and as the years passed, technology continued to grow and evolve while leaving those without skills behind. As cloud based technologies continue to improve and grow, workers in the ever growing IT industry are required to learn new skills or learn new roles. Business organisations are required to provide proper training programs to reskill workers. Google and Amazon provide certificates for people to broaden their skills to take a step closer into becoming a cloud practitioner.
Uneven playing field - The increase in cloud computing has lowered barriers of entry for businesses and allowed efficiency and lower cost benefits. However, with the growth of large cloud companies such as AWS, Google and Azure, companies may need to consider non-traditional ecosystem relationships. These large cloud companies have the most data and resources, their growth will cause them to continue dominating the market, and eventually the question will arise whether cloud-enabled technologies will be a democratising force or will create an oligopolistic or monopolistic society.
Opportunities
Due to the increase in demand for cloud computing, the global cloud computing market is likely to surpass $1 trillion by 2024. The revenue of Amazon web services(AWS), the largest cloud service provider alone, expanded from 44 billion US dollars in 2020, and is expected to reach 62 billion US dollars the following year. AWS has also announced nine more availability zones and three more regions. This creates more job opportunities for cloud engineers and cloud architects who are responsible for designing and maintaining the cloud architecture and solutions architects who are responsible for aiding customers in implementing cloud technologies in their businesses. Companies like AWS and Google provide certificates, which is a more cost efficient alternative compared to a degree which requires a lot more time and money.

The evolution of cloud computing is beneficial towards me in my daily life. As a student, I need to store many files and documents. Therefore the use of cloud is beneficial as it is cost efficient. Purchasing physical storage on a laptop is expensive for many students, therefore I think the use of cloud storage is beneficial and cost efficient for us. The use of cloud in shopping websites is convenient for me, for example there is a ‘recently used’ option, which is a direct result from cloud services. As a broke indecisive student, this is very convenient for me to keep track and compare multiple products across websites. Even the use of navigation apps cause me to indirectly use cloud, as navigation apps like google maps use cloud navigation to ensure the maps and direction displayed are up to date via a network connection. This is especially helpful towards an international student like myself in melbourne as I still get lost navigating through the city. Online cloud based software such as Microsoft Teams, which is currently being used by my group mates and I to communicate for team meetings, or even discord, which is used by my friends and I to communicate with each other when playing games. Without these cloud based applications, I would be unable to communicate with my friends for my assignments and when playing games. Social media apps like facebook and instagram also utilise cloud to store pictures and data. Social media is a big part of my everyday life, and of many others too I’m sure. All this is possible due to the usage of cloud computing. However, for the older members of my family and of many others, they are unlikely to transition to using cloud technologies for storage purposes, due to their lack of knowledge and unwillingness to transition from something they’re comfortable with.

            <h2>Robots</h2>
            <img src="robot.jpg" alt='Robot' height='500px'>  
        <p>
            Robots are machines that are programmed by computers to perform a series of actions automatically. It can replicate a human being and is able to mimic human movement and functions automatically. But cannot think and have emotions like us, humans, as of now. This is likely to be a function in the future as researchers and developers are essentially updating and upgrading robots to more resemble humans as time goes on.
Robots are diverse. Various robots can have two, four, six, or more legs, some are sizes of a coin and some bigger than a car . Some robots are able to make pancakes, while some can fly in the sky, and others that are capable of landing on Mars. Some robots help hospitals do surgeries and prepare prescription medicines for patients, and others toiling away in dirty factories.
This is all thanks to computer programming and robotics software; these are two major factors that allow a robot to be automated. Through the use of algorithms and artificial intelligence, a robot is able to accomplish what it’s accomplished in the years of its existence.
Robots are capable of performing actions that humans can and cannot perform such as:
Cooking- It can choose recipes from a programmed library, and through the automated actions of measuring, mixing the ingredients, baking broiling, simmering and stirring the meal,
Running- A robot can easily outrun a human being as robots have the ability to store and charge its energy efficiently and use that power effectively. A technical cheetah built by and engineer at MIT is topped with a speed of 30m.p.h, this machines is used to help with recusing activities in areas where the surface isn’t ideal for wheeled robots
Fly- Drones are a type of robot too, it can fly anywhere it wants and it’s can be responsible to monitor areas where humans cannot physically go to, or it can be a device of delivering goods such as packages to people in less than 30 minutes
preparing medications for patients- There are nurse bots operating in the backend of hospitals and pharmacies to locate and grab the medicines. Robots can ensure the productivity in the hospitals as robotics, generally saying minimises error while being extremely fast.
Make deliveries - Robots can deliver anything from packages to online orders, plus room services and food in restaurants which minimises human resources which allows businesses to save tons of money
And some that can perform surgeries- Some hospitals and medical facilities are using robots to assist with their surgery operations, as using robotic assistance gives “more precision, flexibility, and control than is possible with conventional techniques”.
Generally speaking these robots perform somewhat basic tasks and some are required to be controlled by human actions. But in the future this is likely to change, through the use of AI limited memories, theory of mind and self-aware AI. AI limited memories is where the machine can store existing data and create better outputs by using the data. For example, Tesla's self-driving car where it can observe the speed of the car and direction and act accordingly. Theory of mind, this is the technology where AI can connect with human thoughts and understand human thoughts and emotions and where this can be embedded into the robot or machine. Self-aware AI, this is the type of AI in the future. This is the AI where they have independent intelligence, and will make their own decision. These machines “will be smarter than the human mind”. With these technologies, robotic intelligence will perform more like a human being in the future where it not only acts and moves like a human but it is also able to think and have emotions like a human.

Robots are likely to take over 40 percent of our jobs in the next 15 years. AI and robotics will become smarter, and machines will be more humanised in the future. Hence this might make a lot of jobs redundant. This only works in the favour of businesses as implementing robotic operations into the business not only cuts the expense of wage but also increases the productivity of the business, because generally speaking machines are less like to have human errors and businesses don't have to spend time and money to make employees happy as machines and robots doesn't have feelings and emotions, so this only works in the favour of business owners. For employees this is bad news for them as their jobs will most likely be replaced by AIs and robots, research shows that 86% of HR professionals admit it is possible for their jobs to be replaced by AI in the future, with 28% of them thinking the chance is highly likely. The people that are most affected are those in the industries of
Automotive, beverage, computers, consumer goods, e-commerce, electronics, and food exact jobs that are likely to be replaced by AI are; couriers/delivery people, doctors, accountants, security guards and taxi and bus drivers. These are the industries that are likely to be replaced by AI and robots in the future. However, automations provide the opportunity for humans to focus on higher skilled, higher quality and higher paid tasks. Therefore this may also create jobs and opportunities for us, jobs such as robot maintenance and creation could be created. This also creates a positive impact on labor demand and wages, as for the fear of being unemployed, this can overall increase the quality of the economy as people are trying to be better and better to not get eliminated by robots and AI.

Robots and Ai currently have a pretty small impact on my daily life as of now, but this is likely to change in the future, when I step into the workforce. It impacts me now in the convenience of my life. For example, we have a self-cleaning device at home where it can detect dirty spots in the room and avoid any objects in front of it. This saves me and the family time and effort to clean the house where we could be doing other stuff. Recently i've been to a restaurant where my food was served with a robotic machine, in my opinion it wasn't as effective as a human waitress because it would often run into walls and other people's chairs, this is due to the AI technology not yet mature. As I said, robots can create convenience for all humankind, for my family and friends where they are super busy so they can build a smart home where they can control the cleaning, cooking and laundry of the house. Despite the convenience of robots, it could also bring unpleasant factors for my family and friends as during the years or in the future some of their jobs could be replaced by robot, and they could have difficult time finding new jobs as they dont have the time or the ability to study and move into another industry of jobs.
Not only is it effective but it is also efficient in areas of operation for businesses. This is a major factor I will have to consider in the future of my life as I wouldn't study or prepare to work in the areas or industries where robotics are likely to replace. Therefore i wouldn't consider stepping into the jobs similar to couriers/delivery people, doctors, accountants, security guards and taxi and bus drivers as listed above.

        <h2>Blockchain & Crypto</h2>
        <img src="bitcoin.jpg" alt='Bitcoin' height='500px'>  
        <p>
            According to IBM. “Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.”

The innovation of Blockchain technologies is important and significant because it provides immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored on an untamperable ledger that can only be accessed through permitted network members. This technology is superior to storing information and transactions on a server as it is more secure and more efficient as servers can be directly attacked to gain unauthorised access to tamper, destroy or steal data.

When a transaction occurs it is stored as a “block” of data and can store a wide variety of data. This block is connected to the blocks before it and the blocks that will come after it forming a “chain”. These blocks link securely to prevent modifications and blocks being added in between in the chain. As the chain increases in size, the blocks that are added make the entire chain more secure and greatly reduces the chances that the blockchain becomes maliciously tampred

Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that uses blockchain technology to allow for it to be decentralised, not requiring banks or governments to control or manage it. This is because everyone has access to the same ledger and information that cannot be altered making it a secure means for transactions.

In terms of blockchain, having an immutable ledger means that data and transactions can be stored securely without being modified and can be stored privately through private blockchain networks. Blockchain technology is being used for quick money transfers without the need of a bank. In the near future we could see much more widespread adoption and is also in use for supply chains to quickly pinpoint items and figure out inefficiencies in the supply chain. There are many other potential use cases for blockchains in many different industries such as; Businesses, for higher profits and lower costs to operate while also being more efficient.

In terms of cryptocurrency, as its name states, its use as a currency has only become more and more popular since its inception and is becoming more accepted and used like a legitimate currency as time goes on. However since it is a new technology, it is not widespread as a traditional means of currency and not used everywhere and its volatility makes it more attractive as an investment opportunity rather than a primary means of currency. However we are already seeing governments and other organisations push the idea to regulate cryptocurrency to make it a more legitimate and stable currency and prevent it being used for fraudulent activities. Within the near future we could see regulations and governments passing bills that make cryptocurrency a widely accepted form of currency exchange internationally and domestically , increasing its adoption and use. However, because of the potential that crypto can become more regulated, its volatility may diminish and as a result it may not be as attractive as an investment option
Ben Mann from Development Alternatives Incorporated (DAI), an expert in the exploration of the applications of blockchain states, “Bitcoin is the one solid, mostly-undisputed success story of blockchain”, however he also states that “there are lots of obstacles to come (with blockchain development), but I am hopeful that it can serve a purpose”. Mann elaborates and states that applications of blockchain are very resource intensive and most probably won't work in countries “where the government frequently shuts down the internet, where there is civil unrest, or poor energy infrastructure”. Despite these drawbacks there are potential beneficial impacts of blockchain if developed. If viable, Blockchain technologies could replace current systems in businesses, banks, legal institutions, government systems and many other potential applications such as real estate. This will affect people doing any sort of meaningful transaction in a business/organisation perspective, instead of transactions and other information being stored on a server or even paper in some cases, it can be stored quickly and securely on a blockchain that is less likely to be corruptible or destroyed than other methods. This will create, replace and make redundant technologies and jobs. In terms of jobs, if blockchain is seen as more effective than servers and databases, database and server managers and maintainers might get replaced with blockchain developers. Some banking jobs might become redundant as transfers and other services can be stored entirely on the blockchain. The most likely technology that blockchains will challenge but most probably not replace are servers and databases. Databases are a more cost effective and less resource intensive way to store data in comparison to blockchain.

In terms of cryptocurrency, this will most likely have an effect on businesses, banks and governments if crypto currency becomes a more dominant and more adopted type of currency, traditional domestic currency may compete or even be replaced by cryptocurrency, encouraging businesses, banks and governments to change their processes and the jobs they supply to facilitate this greater adoption.

How will this affect you? (300 words) In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?

If Blockchain and cryptocurrency become much more prevalent and dominant in my time, a lot of my day to day life would change because of it. Many financial related interactions may use blockchain technology and these transactions/interactions may even be surrounding cryptocurrency. Many other businesses and services that I will interact with such as postage tracking, legal services, real estate, and many other services may use blockchain technology to securely track, store data and transactions. Instead of transactions with domestic currency I may be paying with a cryptocurrency or potentially many different types of cryptocurrency. Instead of tracking items to be delivered from a website linked to a server, the tracking might use blockchain technology instead. Written forms and documents might be completely replaced with blocks of data storing the same information on a secure private blockchain. Family and friends may be able to manage real estate that they own much more efficiently since information can be stored on a blockchain rather than a collection of documents. Identity and information theft can also be reduced since documents can be completely digital and secure through blockchain. However in some cases a complete changeover to blockchain technology may not be ideal for less tech savvy individuals who prefer physical documents.

            <h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
            <img src="teslamodel3.jpg" alt='teslamodel3' height='500px'>  
            <p>Autonomous vehicles, also known as unmanned vehicles, computer-driven vehicles, or wheeled mobile robots, are intelligent vehicles that realise unmanned driving through computer systems. Self-driving cars rely on artificial intelligence, visual computing, radar, surveillance devices, and global positioning systems to work together to allow computers to operate motor vehicles autonomously and safely without any human intervention.
The rationale for a sustainable transport environment comes from political and economic will and the rapid introduction of information and communication technologies into passenger vehicles. The motivating factors for vehicles being built with intelligent capabilities are laid out initially. A description of the navigation problem is given to understand the functions needed for a vehicle to navigate autonomously. To give an overall perspective on how technology is converging towards vehicles with autonomous capabilities, advances have been classified into driver-centric, network-centric and vehicle-centric. Vehicle manufacturers are introducing Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) at a rapid pace; these are Driver Centric systems that facilitate driver awareness. This has led to the introduction of traffic sensors that can be used in situations, and technologies that are advancing from simple to more controllable.
At present, the development trend of the global driverless car industry is good, but there are few areas where mass production has been put into use. Autonomous driving technology, 5G communication technology and related technologies of new energy vehicles will develop together. International leading institutions are suspected of completing the research and development of driverless cars and entering the trial operation and commissioning stage. Most domestic companies developing driverless cars are now in the experimental stage, that is, the development of the industry is in its infancy.
With the continuous maturity of driverless technology and the introduction and adjustment of government policies, driverless vehicles are expected to be used first in industrial development, then in the commercial field, and finally in civilian use. It is expected that around 2035, the global driverless car will gradually replace the traditional car and enter the explosive stage of sales.
The widespread use of driverless cars would reduce traffic accidents and the economic costs that result from them. The autonomous vehicles will be able to use their efficient driving to save on energy costs. The potential economic benefit from this project is huge. There will also be some unintended consequences of autonomous vehicles. </p>
            <p>First, some people may become unemployed. When cars, trucks and buses start themselves, people who earn their living driving these vehicles will suddenly find themselves out of a job. The U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics reports that in 2019, there were over 2,000,000 people employed as tractor-trailer truck drivers. There's a huge amount of people to be employed as taxi drivers and bus drivers. The combined effect would result in the loss of more than 2.9 million jobs, which is more than the number of jobs lost during the 2008 recession. The number of jobs lost due to the obesity epidemic rises to 4.5 million when you include delivery and light truck drivers. There are a lot of people who work in roles related to driving, so the number of people who work in these positions could increase.</p>
            <p>Secondly, hackers may take over the vehicles. In the past, security experts have been able to exploit flaws in modern automobiles and take control of them. A driverless car would be entirely controlled by computer hardware and software, making it immune to these kinds of attacks. A malicious attacker could find and exploit security holes in any number of complex systems to take over a car or cause it to crash. In addition, future autonomous vehicles may be networked to communicate with each other and send and receive data about other vehicles on the road. If an attack were to occur on an autonomous vehicle network, it could cause all of the cars on the road to stop working.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, autonomous vehicles may cause some people to get Car Sickness. Some passengers in self-driving cars may experience motion sickness, causing nausea and even vomiting.  Motion sickness tends to become more severe if people feel bored and do the activities, such as reading and playing games.</p>
            <p>For me, the effect of autonomous driving is, if I live far from my place of work or the place I would like to go and use autonomous vehicles, I may be able to avoid having to commute. It will be more acceptable since the time usually spent driving can be spent on more productive activities, like reading, sleeping, or simply relaxing. Self-driving cars reduce the need for drunk driving lawyers, as some people in daily life do not face the pressure of driving when a drunk and tired person can sleep in the backseat. Their self-driving cars will bring them home. This will have a significant impact on road accidents and the probability of a traffic accident will be greatly reduced. Autonomous driving can reduce transport energy consumption by up to 90% which could lead to substantial reductions in pollution and emissions in our life. And it will also improve the transport interconnectivity.</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
Our project is a mobile application that is essentially a virtual wallet designed to be a unified hub for all forms of virtual cards, QR codes and virtual tickets. This idea can be innovative because there are many different types of services that can store credit cards (eg: apple pay and google play), and some less popular virtual cards and/or QR Codes used in other non wallet apps may use a different application or not even be available on a virtual wallet service, meaning a user might need multiple applications and multiple accounts to use all their virtual cards on their phone. This application will be designed so that all these cards and scannable codes and items can be stored in one place, as a unified “eWallet”, making a card holder’s life easier and more efficient when dealing with scannable items on their phone.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box7">
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>This idea has come from personal experiences, with statistics and global trends making this idea more viable. When I make cashless payments, the majority of those transactions are made through Apple pay which I find to be much more convenient than taking out my physical wallet. The only time I need to regularly take out my wallet is when taking public transport to touch on and off my miki, which for me personally is a mild inconvenience when we already have these technologies in place in our phones through near field communication (NFC). Although a miki can be stored on mobile through google pay, the initial inconvenience still stands, having multiple wallet/card applications can be less efficient and convenient than a simple physical wallet! Especially when we are moving into a more digitised society
The solution is simple, people can have all their physical cards stored in one wallet, so all that is needed is one application to store everything, not multiple applications. This idea of convenience and practicality is the key motivation for my project. Data proves that this type of technology is becoming increasingly popular, with virtual wallets becoming increasingly more adopted. With 900 million transactions at the start of the pandemic increasing to almost 1.5 billion in 2021, a 25% increase, which is set to go above 33% in the coming years. The growth has been so large in fact that 45% of all eCommerce transactions were through mobile in 2021, which is twice as large as the payments done via debit cards and three times of debit card payments.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The application would have a simple and easy to navigate UI so that a user can access all their items quickly. There will be a variety of features and connections to allow for the maximum amount of cards and scanables as possible, while also making this experience to add them in the app as simple as efficient as possible for the user.
The types of cards, scanables and their connections to the application can be separated into classifications that I have designated and can be either “locally stored” and “redirected”.
Locally stored items means that information is stored directly on the application, which is the most desired form of storage for efficient use, in comparison to redirected items. Redirected items is the less ideal method to access items, this is where the app cannot support the type of item, and must redirect to another application which does.
Internally Supported NFC (locally stored)
When debit card is located in the app and can be used without exiting the application, and can send a signal through the phone's NFC for a successful transaction, this type of card can be called an “internally supported NFC”, in most cases large institution/banks eventually will officially support the card being used in the app as they already do with other major wallets like apple wallet and google pay. This type of classification not only applies to bank cards, but also one time codes and other scannable codes (eg: loyalty reward card and limited time offers) that may be officially supported by the institution to work in the virtual wallet.
User Inserted Scannable Cards (locally stored)
If a scannable item isn't supported by the institution, then the user can take a photo or screenshot of QR code or other scannable item that does not send a signal and then save it in the wallet, making it so that the code can still be scanned in the app without redirecting to another app or even referring to a physical voucher/docket that may have been given to them. This won't be able to work with cards that require NFC to work such as bank cards. However, there is a workaround which will be mentioned next.
Redirectable Cards (redirected)
If any type of card for whatever reason cannot be saved on the app, there is the option to redirect the user to the source app that the card is on, this can be done through granting permissions to the application to have access to redirecting the user to the specific card stored on that app.
App Redirection (redirected)
If the redirection of cards cannot work, the user can manually set a shortcut to open the app where the desired cards are stored, it may not be as efficient as the other methods, but if a user frequently uses the application this may be used in some cases instead of directly
Direct Scan (experimental / questionable legality)
With Apple, Google and Samsung announcing their phones can be used as terminals for businesses to accept payments through their NFC chips, our application has the potential to use the NFC chips in modern smartphones to read the signal provided by a card in close proximity to the phone and duplicate the signal to be stored on the application, to be later used through the application. This should work with all cards that use radio frequency identification (RFID) or have an NFC chip if functional. This should be ideal for cards that are used by hotels or businesses and education institutions that use these cards only in physical form. Despite the intent of this functionality is ultimately for convenience, this can easily be abused by many malicious individuals in many malicious use cases. From credit card skimming and fraudulent transactions as a result, the universality of this function can be easily used for criminal activity and may even increase unauthorised transactions and crimes as a whole.
Ultimately this function would require a lot of testing and legal consultation so that it can be effective while also minimising the amount of criminal activity.
From a business perspective this type of function is currently not available on the market, and being able to use the function effectively may result in the application receiving widespread adoption as there is no other program that does this.
Despite this mobile function being an innovation, personally, if there is still a big risk of this function being used in criminal activity, the idea may be scrapped in its entirety to prevent legal repercussions.
All of that was mentioned prior were ways to store/access your cards in the application, which are the primary functions of the app.
Some other QOL functions:
Managing and sorting cards through folders
Removing cards
Updating cards if they expire or renew
Track previous payments
Customizable UI
Data encryption
Add to application function supported by businesses own applications for (like “add to apple pay” button)

            <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
            <p>To develop the application, a mobile internal development environment (IDE) will be required to develop the fundamentals of the application, something like Visual studio would be appropriate (mostly because Iam familiar with it), but many IDEs can be suitable for this application for a variety of programming languages like java and python.
If the application is being developed through Visual studio, windows workstations would be the computers used to develop the app. Local backups will be made regularly on the computer and also on a server, with a cloud storage service used as offsite backups.
While this application is going to be primarily used with modern smartphones with NFC chips, the application should still work with phones without NFC chips (with limited functionality). So it's important when doing internal testing that a wide range of phones with different operating systems and hardware specifications (especially older phones without NFC chips) are tested for errors and bugs.
A Lot of the data stored on the applications will need to be encrypted so that people trying to gain unauthorised access to the data cannot if they attempt to read the data
Also there will be development builds sent to testers regularly for feedback on UX/UI and if any bugs and errors are present in that build.

        <div class="box9">
            <h2>Skills Required</h2>
            
            <p>There are many skills required to develop this application some of which are quite specialised.
When developing the application, skills in backend and frontend development is important for fundamentals of mobile applications. Knowledge in a viable programming language for this kind of application is needed to build an application that fulfils all of its requirements.
Knowledge in how NFC chips and how to utilise them (especially in mobile phones) is key to be able to make transactions and to potentially develop the “direct scan” feature for this application.
The knowledge on how to store these cards locally on the device so that some features won't require an internet connection (such as NFC data and photos), and the ability to encrypt data so that if the device is stolen people can't access the sensitive data despite having access to the phone.

            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>If the project is successful and gains widespread usage, many more businesses will take the application into consideration when developing cards and scannable items so that they can be natively supported on the app. Users will be able to use all their cards and scannable items in one place, solving the issue of the inconvenience of having multiple virtual wallets, making their lives more efficient and potentially making physical wallets less of a need in society. If the development is successful and widely adopted, hopefully most of the cards and scannable items can be natively supported so that app redirection function is less of a need so that all your items can be stored in the one app, which is ultimately the vision of the project.
